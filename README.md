# **Movie Recommendation System**

This project introduces a content-based Movie Recommender System that suggests movies similar to a user-selected title. The system leverages machine learning techniques, particularly similarity-based algorithms, to analyze movie metadata and identify closely related films. A 'tags' feature is utilized to enhance the recommendation accuracy. Developed using Python and Streamlit, the application offers an interactive interface, while the integration of the TMDb API enriches the user experience by fetching and displaying movie posters. This approach ensures efficient, accurate, and visually engaging recommendations for users seeking similar movie options.
